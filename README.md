   **Project Name and Description**
    - Complement Naive Bayes Classifier 
    - It involves building an algorithm to classify the post of a platform called Chirper as positive comments(Chirps) or negative comments (Caws)..
  
1. **Installation**
### Prerequisites
-Before you can use the Complement Naive Bayes Classifier, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- `numpy` (>=1.0.0)
- `scikit-learn` (>=0.24.0)
- `pandas` (>=1.2.3)
- `matplotlib` (>=2.0.0)
- `seaborn` (>=1.0.0)
- `collections` (>=0.24.0)
- `pandas` (>=1.2.3)
- `matplotlib` (>=2.0.0)

1. **Usage**
    In this section, we'll guide you on how to use the Complement Naive Bayes Classifier for classifying Chirper posts as positive comments (Chirps) or negative comments (Caws). We'll cover the main features and functions of the code.

    ### Step 1: Import the Classifier

To get started, you need to import the Complement Naive Bayes Classifier in your Python script:

```python
from complement_naive_bayes_classifier import ComplementNaiveBayesClassifier

### Step 2: Initialize the Classifier
classifier = ComplementNaiveBayesClassifier(smoothing=0.1)

### Step 3: Train the Classifier
Train the classifier on your dataset. Ensure you have your data prepared in the appropriate format:

X_train, y_train = load_training_data()  # Replace with your data loading function
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

Step 4: Make Predictions

Once trained, you can use the classifier to make predictions on new data:
X_new_data = load_new_data()  # Replace with your data loading function
predictions = classifier.predict(X_new_data)

Step 5: Evaluate the Results

Evaluate the classifier's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score:

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

y_true = load_true_labels()  # Replace with your true labels
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, predictions)
precision = precision_score(y_true, predictions)
recall = recall_score(y_true, predictions)
f1 = f1_score(y_true, predictions)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print(f"Precision: {precision}")
print(f"Recall: {recall}")
print(f"F1 Score: {f1}")

  
2. **Configuration**
    - If your project uses configuration files, API keys, or environment variables, explain how to set these up.
  
3. **Testing**

### Running Tests

To ensure the Complement Naive Bayes Classifier functions correctly and to maintain code quality, we recommend running tests regularly. Follow these steps to run tests for the project:

1. **Install Testing Dependencies**:

 In this structure:

- **Running Tests**: Users are guided on how to install testing dependencies, run tests, and adapt the commands for the specific testing framework in use.

- **Testing Framework**: Users are informed about the testing framework being used (in this case, `pytest`). You can replace it with the actual framework you are using.

- **Writing Tests**: Users interested in contributing or expanding the test suite are directed to the project's `tests` directory, where they can find examples and resources to help them write additional tests.

This format helps users understand how to test your project, whether for validation or contribution, and provides information about the testing framework you've chosen.



Remember to use clear and concise language, and include as much relevant information as possible without overwhelming the reader. Well-structured READMEs can greatly enhance the user experience and encourage collaboration on your Python project.
